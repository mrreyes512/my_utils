“Grin and bear it” isn’t about pretending it doesn’t hurt. It’s about choosing to carry on in spite of the pain. It’s knowing the work is uncomfortable, the load is heavy, and the finish line feels far off. Acknowledge the suck and smile, because you know it can’t crush you.

## Workout
This workout is about that mindset. Shouldering the burden, pushing through the fatigue, and finding the strength to keep moving even when every muscle is asking you to stop.
Lean into the hurt. And smile, because frowning won’t fix a thing.
