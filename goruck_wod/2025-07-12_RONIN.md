> A ronin is a samurai with no master. No clan. No orders to follow. Cast adrift by the death of a lord or the fall of a house, a ronin walks alone—but not without purpose.
In a world that values structure, certainty, and the chain of command, the ronin lives by his own code. That’s the thing about true discipline: it isn’t loyalty to someone else’s schedule. It’s what you do when no one’s watching. When there’s no reward waiting at the end. Just the quiet knowledge that you didn’t flinch.

## Workout
Every day is a test of that spirit. There’s no one telling you how to pace yourself. No safety net, no shortcut, no hand on your shoulder. Just you, the challenge, and the question: who are you when everything else falls away?
Be your own master. Move with honor. Fight like your name depends on it.
