> Strong things don’t take shape in comfortable conditions. Early civilizational development is measured according to how much we could turn up the heat–the progression from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. Progress does not come naturally; it is forged.
The same goes for people. Tough tasks create tough people. One of the most remarkable elements of human anatomy is that change–improvement–is triggered by going harder than your body wants to. That’s why it’s so important to challenge yourself every day, physically and otherwise. Strong people aren’t forged on the couch.
