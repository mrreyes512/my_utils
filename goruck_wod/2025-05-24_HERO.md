> [!abstract]- Workout Notes
> 
> Before antiheroes became all the rage, we could model ourselves after the characters we watched. As cool as Tony Soprano and Walter White are, they’re not quite models of the type of person we want to be. So we have to look to older heroes. Beowulf loses his first battle with the dragon. Luke Skywalker loses to Darth Vader. But they both go to great lengths to get another shot, and to be prepared when they do. That’s what we’re about, that’s what Tribe’s about. It’s your attitude toward challenges. Are you going to back down or let it destroy you? No. Accept the challenge and let it change you into a stronger version of yourself. Be the hero.
